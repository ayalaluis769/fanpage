                                    <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Stan Lee was born Stanley Martin Lieber on December 28,
                                        1922, in New York City to Romanian immigrants Celia and Jack Lieber. With part
                                        of his childhood spent during the Great Depression, Lieber and his younger
                                        brother, Larry, watched his parents struggle to make ends meet for the family.

                                        Lieber, who later shortened his name to "Lee" as a writer, went on to be hired
                                        as an office assistant at Timely Comics in 1939 and became an interim editor for
                                        the company in the early 1940s. Lee also served domestically in the Army during
                                        World War II, working as a writer and illustrator.</p>

                                    <p class="d-none d-sm-block">In the early 1960s, Lee was called upon by his boss to
                                        create a series for Marvel Comics (Timely's new name) that could compete with
                                        rival DC Comics' hit title Justice League of America. Citing writing influences
                                        like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Jules Verne, and following the encouragement of
                                        his wife, Joan, Lee did away with some of the usual superhero conventions.
                                        Hence, with artist and co-creator Jack Kirby, the Fantastic Four was born in
                                        1961.</p>

                                    <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Following the success of the Fantastic Four, a slew of
                                        new characters soon sprung from Lee and his Marvel cohorts, including the Hulk,
                                        Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Daredevil and the X-Men.

                                        Lee was particularly known for his dynamism with copy and for imbuing his
                                        characters with a sense of humanity, tackling real-world issues like bigotry and
                                        drug use, which would influence comics for decades. An outgoing, humorous
                                        showman, he also developed a number of slogans as part of his shtick, including
                                        a Latin-derived call to rise, "Excelsior!"

                                        Marvel Comics became a highly popular franchise, and Stan Lee was promoted to
                                        editorial director and publisher in 1972. He later moved to the West Coast to be
                                        involved in Marvel's film ventures and eventually became chairman emeritus.</p>

                                        filed lawsuits against the company and been the subject of debate over
                                        appropriate compensation for comic creators. The writer has seen Marvel develop
                                        into an entity that has inspired blockbuster film entertainment like the Iron
                                        Man, X-Men, Thor and The Avengers franchises. Lee started an
                                        intellectual-property company called POW! Entertainment in 2001 and the
                                        following year published his autobiography, Excelsior! The Amazing Life of Stan
                                        Lee. Later in the decade he received a Medal of Arts honor from President George
                                        W. Bush and launched the History Channel show Stan Lee's Superhumans, a series
                                        that looked at people with remarkable skills and abilities.

                                        2012 saw more new ventures. Lee co-wrote a graphic novel, Romeo and Juliet: The
                                        War, which landed on The New York Times' best-seller list and launched a YouTube
                                        channel, Stan Lee's World of Heroes, which features comics, comedy and sci-fi
                                        content. At the end of the year, the ever-active Lee turned 90.

                                        for an irregular heartbeat and shortness of breath the following January.
                                        However, the comic book titan was discharged shortly afterward and announced he
